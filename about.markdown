I am a Computer Science graduate from BITS Pilani and a Software Development intern at Amazon. I am a competitive programmer as well as a backend developer. I am also a Google Summer of Code'20 student at OpenMRS and have been contributing to open source for a while now.

I like exploring and learning new technologies, especially on the backend side but am open to learning things on the frontend stack as well. I have always liked working with algorithms and using them wherever possible in different aspects of life!

My most favourite hobby is playing sports, well name a sport and there's a high chance that I like playing it. I also like listening to pleasant music. Last but not the least, I like talking to people a lot. So, if you have nobody to talk to and want to have a good conversation about anything and everything, feel free to drop me a line.
